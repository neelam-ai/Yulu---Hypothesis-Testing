# Yulu-Hypothesis-Testing
Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They wanted to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

Section 1:Define Problem Statement and perform Exploratory Data Analysis

    Observations on shape of data, data types of all the attributes, conversion of categorical attributes to
    'category' (If required) , missing value detection, statistical summary.
    
    Univariate Analysis (distribution plots of all the continuous variable(s) barplots/countplots of all the categorical variables)
    
    Bivariate Analysis (Relationships between important variables such as workday and count, season and count, weather and count.
    
    Illustrate the insights based on EDA
    
      Comments on range of attributes, outliers of various attributes
      
      Comments on the distribution of the variables and relationship between them
      
      Comments for each univariate and bivariate plots

Section 2: Hypothesis Testing

    2- Sample T-Test to check if Working Day has an effect on the number of electric cycles rented 

    ANNOVA to check if No. of cycles rented is similar or different in different 1. weather 2. season 

    Chi-square test to check if Weather is dependent on the season
